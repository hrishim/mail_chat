# RAG Implementation Notes

This document captures the implementation details, learnings, and insights about the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system used in the mail_chat project.

## Overview

The mail_chat project implements RAG using:
- NVIDIA AI Endpoints for embeddings
- FAISS vector store from `langchain_community.vectorstores`
- Document handling via `langchain_core.documents`
- Both Simple RAG and Conversational Chain approaches

## Key Components

### Reranking System
- Uses NVIDIAEmbeddings from `langchain_nvidia_ai_endpoints`
- Implements cosine similarity scoring for document relevance
- Supports both Simple RAG and Conversational Chain methods

### Vector Store
- Uses FAISS from `langchain_community.vectorstores`
- Stores and retrieves email chunks efficiently
- Enables semantic search capabilities
